# Arduino Assignments


### Week 1 to 3:
Spent understanding how the code works as well as how to incorporate millis and delay.

### Week 4 to 7: 
Tried to incorporate the code.

### Week 7 to 9:
Week 9 was the last week, managed to kindof incorporate the code still working on it and intend to continue.



Over the course of the 9 weeks we were able to understand the various code presented to us. The concept of the program was fairly interesting and I intend to further investigate it, however, we were provided with little to no instruction aswell as guidance and so at many points the class was very confusing.
